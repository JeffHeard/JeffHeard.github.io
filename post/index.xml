&lt;p&gt;The last project I worked on at UNC was as Chief Software Architect of the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.hydroshare.org&#34;&gt;Hydroshare&lt;/a&gt; project. It was the most challenging
exercise I ever undertook at UNC, and I&amp;rsquo;m proudest of it, despite the fact that
I can&amp;rsquo;t claim to have done everything &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt;. In fact I made some blunders,
but ones I hope I&amp;rsquo;ve learned from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-team&#34;&gt;The Team&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would say my greatest challenge, professionally, is learning how to train
people. No project before or since Hydroshare has ever given me as much
experience training people to work together on a software project.&lt;/p&gt;
